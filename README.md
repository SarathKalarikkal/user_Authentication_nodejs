This Node.js project provides user authentication functionality along with CRUD operations for managing user-specific data securely. Users can register, log in, and receive access tokens for authentication. With the help of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), users can create, update, and delete their data while ensuring data privacy and security. The project utilizes bcrypt for password hashing, express for building the server, mongoose for interacting with MongoDB, and dotenv for managing environment variables. Express-async-handler is employed for handling asynchronous operations seamlessly. Additionally, the project ensures that only registered users can access their data and only logged-in users can perform CRUD operations on their own data, preventing unauthorized access.
